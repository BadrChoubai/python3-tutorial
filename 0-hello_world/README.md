# Hello, Python!

## The Basics

### Types
```python
# str -> 'str'
# int -> 0
```

### Variables
```python
name = 'John Doe'
age = 20
```

### Functions

Functions in python allow you to write reusable pieces of code, this is useful for when you need to do one thing, multiple times.

```python
# The `def` keyword denotes a function 
def add(num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2
```

*Easter Egg: The Zen of Python; Copy & Paste this in your terminal ```python3 -m this```*
